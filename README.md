# InnoCart 

**InnoCart** is an mobile application designed for residents of Innopolis. The problem that the application solves is the lack of outlets in Innopolis compared to Kazan. Our application will help the residents of Innopolis to contact each other to help deliver the goods they need.

Please get familiar with the terminology of our application:

**Shopper** - a person who is in Innopolis and needs a certain product.    
**Angel** - a person who went to Kazan and is ready to provide a delivery service.

## Usage and Features

**Instructions for an Angel**

The first page you will see after registration is a feed with available orders from Shoppers. You can immediately view the available options and choose the most convenient for you using the filters. In the application, orders can be filtered by *date, weight and type of product*.
After you find a suitable order, click the `Send request` button. Your request will be sent to the creator of the order. All orders with which you interact are in the next tab of the application. You can view the order for which the request was sent in the "Waiting for accept" section. When the shopper accepts the request, your contact information will be available to each other for communication.

**Instruction for Shopper**

To create a new order, click on the button in the middle of the bottom bar. You will be redirected to the order creation page. Create your order specifying the *name, weight, location* where Angel can buy the good in Kazan, the *type* of the good and the *reward* that you offer to the delivery person. You can also upload an *image* of the desired product and describe the details in the *additional information* field. Then click `Push order`. Now your order is in the general feed. In the tab with your orders, you can view Angels ready to take on your order and choose one of them.

**Rating**

Rating function is available in our application. The Angel and the Shopper, after completing the order, will be able to evaluate the work of each other. Thus the rating of both users will be updated. The rating is always visible next to the user's avatar and serves as a criterion for choosing a person that you are going to work with.
